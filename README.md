## Overview

FIRA Applet is a Javacard 3.0.5 compliant and Global Platform 2.3 compliant Secure Element (SE) Card applet, which implements the FIRA specifications[CSML]. It is a subsystem in FIRA CSML Architecture and it is only required for supporting UWB Dynamic STS based ranging sessions. Accordingly, the main purpose of this applet is as follows:
Generate a session key (or sub-session keys), which is used to secure the UWB ranging sessions that use dynamic STS.
Securely exchange the session key securely with peer FIRA applets along with other information in both unicast and multicast ranging scenarios. 
Enable secure exchanging of UWB Application specific information with other FIRA compliant devices.
The secure exchange includes establishing, secure channel which is mutually authenticated and encrypted as specified in the FIRA specifications[CSML]. 
Following reference documents provide background and technical information to understand the SUS Applet design.
